When most people hear the word cybersecurity, their eyes glaze over. They imagine complicated code, hackers in dark hoodies, and a wall of confusing technical jargon. It feels distant, intimidating, and sometimes even scary.  

But truly cybersecurity doesn’t have to be that way.  

Cybersecurity touches all of us, every single day. Whether you’re scrolling on social media, buying something online, or just checking your email, you’re interacting with the digital world in ways that deserve protection. And the good news is protecting yourself online doesn’t always require deep technical knowledge. Sometimes it’s as simple as knowing what to look out for.

## Everyday Cyber: Not Just for Experts

A strong password can stop a hacker before they start.

Recognizing a phishing email can save you from a bad day.
  
Understanding your “digital footprint” can help you stay safe while being yourself online.

These are small steps anyone can take: Students, parents, professionals, or anyone just starting out. You don’t need to be a coder, an engineer, or even “techy” to protect yourself.
